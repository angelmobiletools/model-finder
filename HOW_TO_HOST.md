# How to Host Your Website Online

Your website is a **Static Website** (built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). This means it is very easy and **100% FREE** to host. You do not need expensive servers.

Here are the two best methods:

## Option 1: Netlify (Easiest - Drag & Drop)
**Best for:** Getting online in 30 seconds. No coding tools needed.

1.  **Go to Netlify**: Visit [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
2.  **Prepare Folder**: Make sure your project folder (`support model find`) has `index.html` directly inside it.
3.  **Drag and Drop**: Drag your entire `support model find` folder onto the Netlify page where it says "Drag and drop your site folder here".
4.  **Wait**: It will upload in a few seconds.
5.  **Done!** Netlify will give you a random URL (e.g., `fluffy-cupcake-123.netlify.app`). You can click "Site Settings" to change the name to something like `modelfinder-angel.netlify.app`.

## Option 2: GitHub Pages (Professional)
**Best for:** Long-term projects, ease of updating code.

1.  **Create Custom Account**: Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and sign up.
2.  **New Repository**: Click the `+` icon and select **New repository**.
    - Name it (e.g., `model-finder`).
    - Select **Public**.
    - Click **Create repository**.
3.  **Upload Files**:
    - Click **"uploading an existing file"**.
    - Drag **ALL** your files (index.html, app.js, style.css, logos folder, scripts folder, etc.) into the box.
    - Wait for them to load.
    - Scroll down and click **Commit changes**.
4.  **Activate Pages**:
    - Go to **Settings** (tab at the top of your repo).
    - Scroll down (or click "Pages" in the left menu) to the **GitHub Pages** section.
    - Under **Source**, select `main` (or `master`) branch.
    - Click **Save**.
5.  **Done!** Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/model-finder/`.

## Important Checks Before Hosting
Before you upload, make sure:
- [x] **index.html** is in the main folder (not inside a subfolder).
- [x] **File names** are correct (case-sensitive on the web). `Style.css` and `style.css` are different on the web! (We have kept everything lowercase/consistent so you should be fine).
- [x] **Logos**: Ensure your `logos` folder is uploaded properly so images show up.
